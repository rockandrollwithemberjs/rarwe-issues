Please make sure you're reporting an error about the latest book version.

You can find that by comparing [the date of the latest release here](https://github.com/rockandrollwithemberjs/rarwe-issues#releases-of-the-book) with the timestamp in the Preface of the book ("You are reading version YYYYMMDD of this book.").

**Describe the error**

**Page number**

**The output of `ember -v` in the project**

This is only relevant for code-related errors, feel free to delete the section otherwise (for example, for typos)

**Additional context**

Only if necessary, feel free to delete this section otherwise.

Most importantly, thank you for taking the time to help me improve the book!
